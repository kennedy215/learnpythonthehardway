# Study Drills
# 1. In Terminal, where you normall run python to run your scripts, type
# pydoc raw_input instead
# 2. Get out of pydoc by typing q to quit
# 3. Look online for what the pydoc command does.

# 4. Use pydoc to also read about open, file, os and sys. It's alright if you
# do not understand those; just read through and take notes about interesting things
# Using pydoc is great!
