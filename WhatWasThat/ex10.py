# 1. Memorize all the escape sequences by putting them on flash cards.
# 2. Use ''' (triple-single-quote) instead. Can you see why you might
# use that instead of """?
# ''' are treated as regular strings that can span multiple lines.
# Combine escape sequences and format strings to create a more complex format.
# Remember the %r format? Combine %r with double-quote and single-quotes# escapes
# and prints them out. Compare %r with %s. Notice how %r prints it in the
# way you'd write it in your file, but %s prints it the way you'd like to
# see it?
